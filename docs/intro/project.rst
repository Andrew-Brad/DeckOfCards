The Project
^^^^^^^^^^^

Why a Deck of Cards?

Most demo apps have to be written and/or presented within the space of 1-2 hours.  This means that there's a slew of material out there that ends up being 'to-do lists', and stripped down e-commerce applications.

While these may work for demoing specific pieces of functionality, this project exists as a reference as to how to build testable, maintainable software.
